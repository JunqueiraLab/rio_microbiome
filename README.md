## About the data
Each point on the map represents a collected sample.  
Clicking on a point reveals metadata, including:

- **Sample ID**  
- **Collection Date**  
- **Surface**  
- **Material Type**  
- **Specific Material**  
- **City**  
- **Humidity**  
- **Temperature**  
- **Total DNA (ng)**

## How it works
The map was generated in **R** using the [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package and exported as a standalone HTML file.  
It is hosted via **GitHub Pages** for easy access by reviewers and collaborators.
